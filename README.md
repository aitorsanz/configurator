configurator
============

This is a prototype web-based assistant that helps build SciDB config.ini files.

To build config.ini for SciDB 14.12, visit:

http://htmlpreview.github.com/?https://raw.github.com/Paradigm4/configurator/master/config.14.12.html

Alternatively, you may download the file config.14.12.html and run it on your machine.

To build config.ini for an earlier SciDB release, you may visit the above link
but alter the release number in the URL to what you want.
